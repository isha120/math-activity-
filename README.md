What is Euler's formula?
Euler's formula, either of two important mathematical theorems of Leonhard Euler. ... It is written F + V = E + 2, where F is the number of faces, V the number of vertices, and E the number of edges. A cube, for example, has 6 faces, 8 vertices, and 12 edges and satisfies this formula.

How did Euler prove his formula?
Image result
The original proof is based on the Taylor series expansions of the exponential function ez (where z is a complex number) and of sin x and cos x for real numbers x (see below). In fact, the same proof shows that Euler's formula is even valid for all complex numbers x. Ï† = arg z = atan2(y, x).


Why does Euler's formula work?
Image result for euler formula
Euler's formula deals with shapes called Polyhedra. ... Euler's Formula does however only work for Polyhedra that follow certain rules. The rule is that the shape must not have any holes, and that it must not intersect itself. (Imagine taking two opposite faces on a shape and gluing them together at a particular point.04-Jun-2015
